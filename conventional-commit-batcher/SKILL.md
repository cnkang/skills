# Conventional Commit Batcher

Use this skill to turn a messy working tree into clean, reviewable Conventional Commit history.

## Commit Interception (MANDATORY)

This skill MUST be activated for ANY commit-related operation, including:
- user asks to commit, stage, or push changes
- user asks to "save" or "check in" code
- any workflow that would result in `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`

Do NOT run `git add` or `git commit` directly without going through this
skill's workflow.

## Use This Skill When

- any commit operation is performed through an agent (automatic interception)
- changes from different intents are mixed in one branch
- you want a plan-first commit process before opening a PR
- you need reliable Conventional Commit messages across team and agents

## Skip This Skill When

- the change is tiny and clearly single-intent
- you only need one quick commit without batching

Note: even when the skill could be skipped, if it is installed, the agent will
still run the workflow and safety gates. The result may be a single batch, which
is fine.

## Default Behavior: Auto-Execute

By default, the skill inspects changes, splits into logical batches, runs
safety gates, and commits directly — without waiting for user confirmation.

To see the plan before execution, explicitly ask:

```text
Show me the commit plan first before executing.
```

## High-Success Prompt (Plan-First Mode)

Use this prompt only when you want to review the plan before execution:

```text
Inspect my current git changes and split them into logical Conventional Commit batches.
Output a full Commit Plan first.
Do not run git add or git commit until I confirm the plan.
After confirmation, execute each batch one by one.
```

## Output Contract

In auto-execute mode (default), the agent outputs a brief per-batch summary as
each batch is committed.

In plan-first mode (user requested), the agent outputs the full plan before
any staging/commit:

```text
Commit Plan
Batch #1: <type(scope): subject>
Intent: <why this batch exists>
Files/Hunks:
- <path> (...)
Staging commands:
- git add ...
Commit command:
- git commit -m "..."
```

## Required Behavior

- Always load `references/core-rules.md` first.
- Treat `references/core-rules.md` as the single source of truth.
- Run `python3 scripts/precommit_safety_gate.py` before every commit attempt
  when Python is available; otherwise run the equivalent manual gate checks
  from `references/core-rules.md`.
- Run the sensitive-data gate before every commit and require explicit user
  confirmation if risky files/hunks are detected.
- When any gate reports risk, include triggered file paths and brief evidence
  in user-facing output, plus a concrete "please review" suggestion.
- Run the `.gitignore`/local-artifact gate before every commit and require
  explicit user confirmation if suspicious files are present.
- Run branch/conflict/large-file/empty-stage safety checks before every commit.
- Never skip commit-time checks with `--no-verify`.
- If check/hook fails, stop and report concise diagnostics.

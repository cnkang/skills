# Core Rules (Canonical)

This file is the single source of truth for commit batching behavior across:

- Codex
- Claude Code
- Kiro CLI
- Kimi CLI
- Qwen Code
- Gemini CLI
- OpenAI agents

## Execution Mode

Default mode: **auto-execute**. The agent inspects changes, splits into logical
batches, runs safety gates, and commits directly without waiting for user
confirmation.

Plan-first mode: activated only when the user explicitly requests to see the
plan before execution (e.g., "show me the plan first", "let me review before
committing"). In this mode, output the Commit Plan and wait for user
confirmation before staging or committing.

Safety gate confirmations are independent of execution mode. If a safety gate
requires user confirmation (sensitive data, protected branch, etc.), the agent
MUST still pause and ask regardless of execution mode.

## Execute Workflow

1. Inspect current repository state.
2. Classify changes and split into logical batches.
3. Run safety gates before each batch.
4. **Auto-execute mode (default):** stage and commit each batch directly.
   **Plan-first mode (on user request):** output the full Commit Plan, wait
   for explicit user confirmation, then stage and commit.
5. Validate every commit message before each commit.
6. Run commit normally and let commit-time checks execute.
7. Re-check history and working tree after each batch.
8. After all batches, output a brief summary of what was committed.

## Batch Decision Rubric (5 Lines)

1. If primary intent differs, split commits.
2. If acceptance criteria differs, split commits.
3. If rollback decision differs, split commits.
4. If release timing differs, split commits.
5. If all four are the same, keep one cohesive commit.

## Inspect Repository State

Run:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff
```

If staged changes already exist, inspect both staged and unstaged:

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

Classify each changed file by intent:

- behavior change (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`)
- tests (`test`)
- docs (`docs`)
- tooling or CI (`build`, `ci`, `chore`)
- formatting-only (`style`)

## Safety Gate Execution Mode (Required)

Use one of these two equivalent ways before every commit:

1. Preferred (deterministic, testable):

```bash
python3 scripts/precommit_safety_gate.py
```

2. Fallback (when Python is unavailable):

- run the manual gate commands in this file
- apply the same decision policy (`confirm` vs `block`)
- do not skip any gate

Why keep the script:

- it turns rules into deterministic checks
- it supports repeatable regression tests
- it can be reused in git hooks and CI pipelines

Script exit code contract:

- `0`: pass
- `2`: explicit user confirmation required (rerun with matching `--allow-*`)
- `3`: blocked (must fix before commit)

Finding report contract (required for both script and manual fallback):

- always state which gate triggered
- always list exact files that triggered the finding
- include short evidence (matched line snippet or hunk summary)
- include a concrete suggestion (review/remove/redact/confirm)

## Sensitive Data Gate (Required)

Before every commit attempt, inspect staged file names and staged diff for
sensitive data risk.

High-risk file/path indicators (examples):

- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.jks`
- `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, `id_ed25519`
- files/paths containing `secret`, `secrets`, `credential`, `credentials`,
  `token`, `password`

High-risk content indicators (examples):

- `BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY`
- `api_key`, `access_token`, `secret_key`, `client_secret`
- hardcoded password-like values in config or source

Hard requirement:

- If any high-risk indicator appears in a planned or staged batch, stop and ask
  user for explicit confirmation before commit.
- Do not proceed with `git commit` until user confirms those files/hunks are
  intentional.
- In confirmation requests, include the triggered file list and at least one
  matched snippet per file when available.
- If user says accidental inclusion, unstage/remove the risky parts and update
  the plan before continuing.

## Ignore Rules Gate (Required)

Before staging and before each commit, verify that local-only or generated files
are not accidentally included.

Required checks:

```bash
git status --short --untracked-files=all
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Hard requirement:

- Cross-check staged files against `.gitignore` intent (local configs, caches,
  env files, temp/build artifacts).
- If a file looks local-only, generated, or environment-specific, stop and ask
  user to confirm whether it should be committed.
- If it should not be committed, remove it from staging immediately.
- If ignore rules are missing, update `.gitignore` (usually as a separate
  `chore` commit).
- If a tracked file should become ignored, untrack it first (for example
  `git rm --cached <path>`) and then update `.gitignore`.

## Branch Safety Gate (Required)

Before every commit, verify the current branch is expected for this task.

Required check:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Hard requirement:

- If current branch is protected or release-oriented (for example `main`,
  `master`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`), pause and ask user for explicit
  confirmation before commit.
- If user did not intend this branch, stop and switch/create the right branch
  before staging/committing.

## Conflict Marker Gate (Required)

Before every commit, ensure staged changes contain no merge conflict markers.

Required checks:

```bash
git diff --cached | rg '^(<<<<<<< |=======|>>>>>>> )'
git diff --cached --name-only
```

Hard requirement:

- If any conflict marker appears, stop immediately.
- Do not commit until conflicts are resolved and markers are removed.

## Large/Binary Artifact Gate (Required)

Before every commit, inspect staged content for unexpected binary or large
artifacts.

Required checks:

```bash
git diff --cached --numstat
git diff --cached --name-only
```

Hard requirement:

- If unexpected binary files or large artifacts appear, pause and ask user for
  explicit confirmation before commit.
- If inclusion is accidental, unstage/remove and update `.gitignore` if needed.

## Commit Plan Output Contract

The Commit Plan format is used in two scenarios:
1. **Plan-first mode** (user explicitly requested): output the full plan and
   wait for confirmation before any staging/commit.
2. **Auto-execute mode** (default): the agent still internally determines the
   same batch structure, but proceeds to execute directly. Output a brief
   per-batch summary as each batch is committed.

Full plan format (used in plan-first mode or when user asks to see the plan):

```text
Commit Plan
Batch #1: <type(scope): subject>
Intent: <why this batch exists>
Files/Hunks:
- <path> (whole file | specific hunk intent)
Staging commands:
- git add <path>
- git add -p <path>   # when partial staging is needed
Commit command:
- git commit -m "<type(scope): subject>"

Batch #2: <...>
...
```

Hard gates (apply to BOTH modes):

- Before each commit, run safety gates via script (preferred) or manual fallback.
- If safety gates require user confirmation (sensitive data, protected branch,
  local artifacts, large/binary files), pause and ask regardless of mode.
- If conflict markers are detected, block commit until resolved.
- If user requests plan changes (plan-first mode), regenerate the full plan and
  wait for confirmation again.
- If intent boundaries are uncertain, ask for clarification before execution.

## Batching Rules

- Keep one commit for one purpose.
- File type alone is not a batch boundary signal.
- Even when files are all docs or all code, split batches if their intent,
  audience, or rule contract differs.
- If two changes are governed by different rules or acceptance criteria,
  they must be separate commits.
- Split by rollback unit: if one part may be reverted without reverting the
  other, they must not share one commit.
- Split by validation path: if changes rely on different checks
  (for example runtime tests vs docs/lint/hook rules), separate commits.
- Split by release timing: if one part can ship now and another should wait,
  separate commits.
- Do not over-split: if intent, acceptance criteria, rollback need, and release
  timing are the same, keep changes in one commit.
- Separate formatting-only edits from behavior changes.
- Separate refactor from fix unless inseparable.
- Keep tests with the behavior they validate.
- Group lockfile updates with the dependency change that requires them.
- Place prerequisite commits first
  (refactor before feature, feature before docs).

Before finalizing each batch, verify all answers are "yes":

- Same primary intent?
- Same acceptance criteria?
- Same rollback need?
- Same release timing?

If any answer is "no", split into different commits.
If all answers are "yes", prefer one cohesive commit.

Reject:

- one large mixed commit
- unrelated files in same commit without shared purpose
- bundling different rule contracts into one commit just because file type matches
- mixing user-facing docs with agent/skill contract updates in one docs commit
- mixing mechanical formatting with behavioral code changes in one code commit
- mixing CI/release pipeline edits with product/runtime behavior changes
- splitting one cohesive logical change into many tiny file-based commits
- committing unresolved conflict markers
- committing on an unintended protected/release branch without confirmation
- committing unexpected binary/large artifacts without confirmation
- commit headers that do not match actual changes

## Stage and Commit Each Batch

Stage only the current batch:

```bash
git add <file1> <file2>
# or
git add -p
```

Verify staged content:

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

Run safety gate (preferred):

```bash
python3 scripts/precommit_safety_gate.py
```

If exit code is `2`, ask for explicit confirmation and rerun with only the
required flags:

```bash
python3 scripts/precommit_safety_gate.py \
  --allow-sensitive \
  --allow-local-artifacts \
  --allow-protected-branch \
  --allow-large-or-binary
```

If Python is unavailable, run the manual checks below instead and keep the same
`confirm` / `block` behavior.

Run sensitive data checks on staged changes:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
git diff --cached
```

For manual fallback without Python, produce file-level evidence:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only | rg -i '(^|/)(\\.env(\\..*)?|id_rsa|id_dsa|id_ed25519)|\\.(pem|key|p12|jks)$|secret|credential|token|password'
git diff --cached --no-color | rg -n -i 'BEGIN .*PRIVATE KEY|api[_-]?key|access[_-]?token|secret[_-]?key|client[_-]?secret|password\\s*[:=]'
```

If risk indicators are detected, pause and ask user explicitly:

```text
[Sensitive Data Confirmation Required]
Potentially sensitive files/hunks detected in this batch:
- <path-or-hunk-summary>

Please review these files first:
- <path>

Matched indicator snippets:
- <path>: <snippet>

Please confirm these are intentional and safe to commit.
Reply with explicit confirmation before I continue.
```

Run ignore/local-artifact checks:

```bash
git status --short --untracked-files=all
git diff --cached --name-only
```

If local-only or generated files are detected, pause and ask user explicitly:

```text
[Ignore Rule Confirmation Required]
Potentially local-only/generated files detected:
- <path>

These may belong in `.gitignore` instead of git history.
Please confirm whether to commit or exclude them.
```

Run branch safety check:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If branch appears protected/release-oriented, ask user explicitly:

```text
[Branch Confirmation Required]
Current branch: <branch>
This branch looks protected or release-oriented.
Please confirm commit should proceed on this branch.
```

Run conflict marker check:

```bash
git diff --cached | rg '^(<<<<<<< |=======|>>>>>>> )'
```

If markers are detected, block commit:

```text
[Commit Blocked: Conflict Markers]
Unresolved merge conflict markers detected in staged changes.
Resolve conflicts and remove markers before commit.
```

Run large/binary artifact checks:

```bash
git diff --cached --numstat
```

If unexpected large/binary files are detected, ask user explicitly:

```text
[Large/Binary File Confirmation Required]
Potential large or binary files detected:
- <path>

Please confirm these files are intentional for this commit.
```

Ensure staged content is not empty:

```bash
git diff --cached --quiet
```

If command exits `0`, there is no staged content and commit must not proceed.

Validate message:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_conventional_commit.py \
  --max-subject-length 72 \
  --max-header-length 100 \
  "<type(scope): subject>"
```

Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "<type(scope): subject>"
```

After each batch, report:

- committed header
- staged file list included in commit
- what remains unstaged/uncommitted

## Commit-Time Checks Policy

- If repository defines commit-time checks (`pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, Husky,
  lint-staged), treat them as mandatory.
- Never use `git commit --no-verify` when checks are configured.
- If no checks are configured, continue normal commit flow.
- If any commit-time check fails:
  - stop further commit attempts immediately
  - report failure output to user quickly
  - wait for user decision before continuing

## Conventional Commit Rules

Allowed types:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `docs`
- `style`
- `refactor`
- `perf`
- `test`
- `build`
- `ci`
- `chore`
- `revert`

Constraints:

- Header format: `<type>(<scope>)!: <subject>`
- Scope optional; validator supports `_` by default
- `!` optional and used for breaking changes
- Commit message language defaults to English (text in subject, body, and
  footer).
- If the user explicitly requests another language, message text in
  subject/body/footer may use that language.
- Do not translate Conventional Commit keywords/tokens (`type`, optional
  `scope`, `!` marker, and `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer token). Keep prefixes like
  `docs`, `feat`, `fix` in standard form.
- No trailing period in subject
- Subject max length default `72`
- Header max length default `100`
- If body/footer exists, keep one blank line after header
- Body is optional; add it only when header alone cannot explain context.
- When body is needed, keep it concise and human-readable; focus on key why/what
  or impact (avoid restating header).
- For very small/simple changes, body may be empty.
- If footer is used, keep tokens standard (for example `BREAKING CHANGE:`) and
  keep footer text concise.

Breaking change rule:

- If message indicates breaking change, require either `!` in header
  or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

Style warnings (default validator behavior):

- Subject starts lowercase when first letter is alphabetic
- Prefer imperative verb (`add`, `fix`, `remove`) over forms like
  `added`, `adding`, `fixed`

## Quality Checks

After each commit:

```bash
git log --oneline -n 5
```

After all batches:

```bash
git status --short
```

Expectations:

- commit order explains evolution clearly
- each commit is independently reviewable
- headers align with actual content
- no leftover partial staging mistakes

## Failure Feedback Template

When commit-time checks fail, return:

```text
[Commit Check Failure Report]
Repository: <absolute-path>
Branch: <branch-name>
Attempted Commit Header: <type(scope): subject>
Failed Check Name: <pre-commit | commit-msg | husky hook name | lint-staged task>
Failed Command: <exact command if visible>
Exit Code: <code or unknown>

Key Error (first 20-60 relevant lines):
<concise excerpt>

What Passed Before Failure:
- Conventional header validation: <pass/fail>
- Staged diff review: <done/not done>

Current Git State:
- `git status --short`
<output>
- `git diff --cached --stat`
<output>

Quick Reproduction:
1. <step>
2. <step>
3. `git commit -m "<same message>"`

Suggested Next Step:
<one concrete fix direction or request permission to investigate>
```

Minimum diagnostics:

- failing hook/check name and command
- exit code
- concise error excerpt
- staged state snapshot
- exact commit message used
